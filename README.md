# SimulationProject
In this project, our team has simulated the traffic junction at Am Fuchsberg/LeipzigerStr - Erich Weinert Str.  The main goal of this simulation is to identify the uniquefeatures of this junction due to which accidents occur and to theorize and simulateexperiments to improve the overall safety at the node with a little or no compromiseto the throughput of the node.
